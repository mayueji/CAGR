For the convenience of users, we provide two GPU versions (1) based on cupy and PGR, and (2) based on pytorch and CUDA. Both can complete orientation and reconstruction tasks. For those under 10K points, it is recommended to use the Cupy version. For those above 10K points, the CUDA version is recommended.
